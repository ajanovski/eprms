url-db-instructions=<h3>DB Access from a DB Management Software</h3><p>The professor recommends using the DBEAVER DB management software (opensource and free), that he can support via a ready-made package (tested at the premises of the Faculty, available for Windows and Linux). You need to download the 7Z package from the link below, unpack it to a folder of choice and start the script START_DBEAVER, otherwise it will not work correctly. </p> <p>The package includes a sample connection configuration, that will be visible if correctly starting via the START_DBEAVER script, and you will have to edit the connection line before attempting a connection.</p> <p> <span class="bg-danger text-light p-2">Note: do not double click the connection line before you have configured it, as the server will block your IP address immediately! </span></p> <p>So, before attempting a connection make sure that you have correctly configured the SSH tunnel parameters, by right-clicking the connection configuration line and choosing the Edit option and use the parameters shown below. You need to carefully configure two sets of parameters in the DBEAVER connection configuration: SSH tunnel parameters and database connection parameters. The two sets are in two separate tabs of the connection configuration window, and you need two separate passwords (for the tunnel and for the database).</p> <p>Detailed instructions are included as a PDF file in the software package.</p><h3>DB Access from your project application</h3><p>Your project application (web site, console app, desktop app) will not be able to access the DB server directly. Instead a SSH tunnel needs to be established to the designated tunneling server that will redirect all your DB requests that come into the tunnel, to the respective DB server. The tunnel can be established either inside from your project application (you will need to include in your project, configure and use a SSH connection library that supports tunneling) or can be established externally by using a third party SSH applications. The professor recommends the second solution as it is easier to support.</p><p>For this case you will need to download an SSH tunneling script (based on the application plink that is part of the PUTTY toolset) that the professor has preconfigured and packaged for your operating system at the link below. Download the script package and unpack it in a folder of your choice, then edit the batch file with a text editor and change the tunnneling user and password using the parameters given below. Once the script is configures it should be run from the command line in your OS and follow the instructions until it noted that the tunnel is established.</p><h3>Packages</h3><p>The packages are available at the address:</p>
