			The professor recommends using the DBEAVER software (opensource and
			free), that he can support via a ready-made package (tested at the
			premises of the Faculty, available for Windows and Linux). You need
			to download the 7Z package, unpack it to a folder of choice and start
			the script START_DBEAVER, otherwise it will not work correctly. The
			packages are available here: <a
				href="https://bazi.finki.ukim.mk/materijali/Software/">https://bazi.finki.ukim.mk/materijali/Software/</a>
		</p>
		<p>The package includes a sample connection configuration, that
			will be visible if correctly starting via the START_DBEAVER script,
			and you will have to edit the connection line before attempting a
			connection.</p>
		<p>
			<span class="bg-danger text-light">Note: do not double click
				the connection line before you have configured it, as the server
				will block your IP address immediately! </span>
		</p>
		<p>So, before attempting a connection make sure that you have
			correctly configured the SSH tunnel parameters, by right-clicking the
			connection configuration line and choosing the Edit option and use
			the parameters shown below. You need to carefully configure two sets
			of parameters in the DBEAVER connection configuration: SSH tunnel
			parameters and database connection parameters. The two sets are in
			two separate tabs of the connection configuration window, and you
			need two separate passwords (for the tunnel and for the database).</p>
		<p>Detailed instructions are included as a PDF file in the
			software package.</p>
