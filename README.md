# EPRMS Project

The EPRMS - Educational Project and Resources Management System is a management information system used to organize the work on student projects, their source repositories and other related resources. 

This is an open-source system, initially developed to demonstrate web application development for a course on Internet Technologies. Nowadays, it is used by the project lead in production to manage project reporting and resource allocation for 4 courses.
